1.  Introduction

   Web Packaging, as currently defined in
   [I-D.yasskin-wpack-bundled-exchanges] and
   [I-D.yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses], is a system to allow
   content authored by one web origin to be retrieved in an optionally-
   trustworthy way from a peer or other intermediate server.  The ESCAPE
   conference [3] was chartered to (among other things) look for any
   increase in consolidation that might result from standardizing Web
   Packaging.  The known possible effects on centralization and power
   imbalances, arranged by the type of service provider, and not
   filtered by benefit, harm, or likelihood, follow.

2.  General

   o  The implementation of any new technology is a smaller fraction of
      a large organization's budget, which pushes toward centralization.

3.  Aggregators

   o  Aggregators' primary power comes from ranking: telling people that
      they probably want to visit particular URLs.  That's not affected
      by packaging.

   o  Aggregators already rank based on sites' content and technology
      choices. e.g.  Google's promotion of HTTPS sites.  Packaging can
      give the aggregator more certainty about the user's experience,
      which might lead to more intrusive requirements.

      For example, the Google Search Carousel might be able to insist on
      particular Javascript that could handle swipe gestures where they
      might not be willing to rely on just having seen such JS on the
      last crawl.  However, packaged Javascript must also be able to
      reload the page from the origin to deal with retracted content,
      and that could break reliance on knowing the exact content in the
      same way.

   o  Prefetch improves navigation speeds from aggregators that can
      predict which links users will click.  The ability to make that
      prediction is an economy of scale which encourages centralization.
      This is likely to have more effect for some kinds of aggregators
      (search engines?) than others (news streams?).

4.  Browsers

   o  Packages add pressure to have just one or a few versions of a
      site's content, which might reduce publishers' willingness to
      support lots of different browser engines with different features.
      They'll either settle on the lowest common denominator with some
      progressive enhancement or target the most popular couple engines,
      which is likely to be Chromium (Google Chrome, Edge, Brave,
      Samsung Internet, Opera, UC Browser, etc.) and WebKit (Safari),
      disadvantaging Gecko (Firefox).

      However, "we only tested in Chrome" is enough of a problem on the
      online web that it's not clear how big an additional impact
      packaging can have.

5.  CDNs

   o  Adding a new kind of distribution might transfer traffic from CDNs
      to large aggregators, which would reduce CDNs' revenue.

   o  However, CDNs will still be needed to serve URLs that users type
      in, bookmark, or navigate to via same-site links, so there's
      disagreement, even among employees of CDNs, about the likely size
      of this effect.

   o  CDNs might be able to acquire even more traffic by offering
      package caches to let smaller sites take advantage of prefetching.

6.  Content Producers

   o  If Web Packages become an additional format publishers need to
      produce (https://xkcd.com/927/), that will advantage the larger
      publishers who can afford the engineering to maintain lots of
      formats.  If instead they replace at least 2 of the existing
      formats (e.g.  AMP, Apple News, Facebook Instant Articles),
      that'll reduce that advantage of larger publishers and contribute
      to decentralization.

   o  If aggregators use packaging to serve a significant fraction of
      content producers' bytes for free, this reduces the amount the
      producers need to pay CDNs, which would allow more marginal
      content producers to stay profitable, increasing diversity.

7.  Other effects not necessarily related to centralization

   o  When an aggregator prefetches a web package, the static content
      will load instantly, but ads and other dynamic content will have a
      visible delay.  Personalization might have a delay or might be
      loaded from local storage effectively instantly.  It's not clear
      what ecosystem effects the changes in loading speed are likely to
      have.
